# Pieces

Package coordinates as proper types in Python.

The name "pieces" comes from how one might say the shorthand "pcs", which as the acronym "PCS" 
means "package coordinate system."

A package coordinate system allows software engineers and developers to uniquely identify a 
build of a software package.

Some common examples:
* `NVR` - `name-version-release` coordinates for RPM packages on RPM-based linux
* `GAV` - `group:artifact:version` coordinates for Maven packages
* `PEP440` - [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) version specifications and dependency 
  identifiers
